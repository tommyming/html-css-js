# Tags And Attributes 

### Tags

Tag is the most important element of a website framework, especially for HTML.

Without the tags, HTML cannot be used. The whole website cannot be called as a website.

Every tag has a start tag and a end tag, please, remember to fucking close the tag.

Balance Structure. 

Most commonly seen tags(Except those <html> <body> <head> shit) : 
```
<h_> <p>
```
They are the most commonly used tags. <h1> means the largest heading, and <p> is paragraph.


### Attributes

Attributes are the decoratives of the tags.

If tag is the noun of the sentence, then attributes are the adjectives.

Mostly seen attributes are: href, style, src, id, class, etc.

Those are tag-specific, not CSS ( which is globally or partically, depends on the place of the css)

The attributes can override other stuffs that are no in the HTML framework.

- Difference between alt and title?

	alt: The alternative name/title of th stuffs.
	title: try to point the mouse on it, you will see the words

Mostly the two will use together.


- Single or Double Quotes?

	Both Ok.
	Unless you want to quote something, you may '""' , like this.

- What is the use of style?

	Actually no use, if you have CSS, or some special style for this pecific tag.

-What is the difference of the id and class?

	There is no very big difference between id and class.
	It just affect the symbols uses in CSS (. and #)
	REALLY NEED Difference, is class is mainly used in cross-html frameworks, for a easier layout.
