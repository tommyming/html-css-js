# Colours and Background

## Colours

It is one of the ***SOUL*** of the style, it allows you to change colours.

The colours can be represented by colour themes, hexadecimal codes, and rgb values (Most commonly used)

### Background colour

It changes the background colour of the specific tag.
```
background-color: asdjioasufnwef
```

### Color
It changes the text color
```
color: drfosdiafaw
```

### Border Color
It changes the border of the color (Preset is NULL in html)
```
border-color: asdhjfwsdf
```

## Background

White space does not always do me a favor, as it is not fancy enough like RGB --- Tommy, 2018

Therefore, we can change the background of the webpage by using CSS styles.

### background colour and image

You can change the background colour or image from that 

```
background-color: blue
background-image: url('')
```

### background repeat 

it is used to show whether the background should be repeated to fill up the whole page.
```
background-repeat: repeat-x / repeat-y
```
So, what if you want a single picture?
no-repeat 

### background attachment, position
Use this to specify the background image place.

```
background-position: left bottom
background-attachment: fixed (will not scroll down)
```

### If you are lazy...
```
background: blue url('') no-repeat fixed right top 
```
color -> image -> repeat -> attachments -> positions


## Border

Border has 2 main stuffs that you need to remember: style and width

```
border-style: double (2 lines)
border-width: 2px 5px 7px 9px (left  up right bottom)
```

***REMEMBER*** 
You must have border-style first.
