# Margins And Padding
These two are the most messy ones for the students to familiar with.

## Margins
Margins is the style that shows the space between the specific tag and the margins of the webpage

It include 4 simple elements:
margin-left/right/top/bottom

You may type them one by one:
```
margin-left: 20px
.
.
.
```

Or, if you are lazy, just type:
```
margin: 20px 30px 40px 50px
```
top -> right -> bottom -> left

or just 1, to automate the margin:
```
margin: 10px
```
So, why there is auto and other elements here?
auto: center from the element, others are white space
inherit: left space, others filled


##padding
***Padding is talking about the __spaces inside__ a division.***

(Same AS margin)
It include 4 simple elements:
margin-left/right/top/bottom

You may type them one by one:

```

Or, if you are lazy, just type:
```
margin: 20px 30px 40px 50px
```
top -> right -> bottom -> left

or just 1, to automate the margin:
```
margin: 10px
```
