So, tell me, wtf is html, css and javascript?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a declarative. You type in the language, the browser (engine) will render it for you. 

It is the CORE of the whole website framework, without it, your website are ready to eat shit.

CSS (Cascading Stylesheet) is a styling language. Makes your website stylish, it controls the colours, frame size, paddings and other styling shit.


JAVASCRIPT is a computing language. It controls the actions of the website, like how it runs, any actions need to take when clicking the specific button. It can also be used to perform backend actions to store and retrieve data. It is easy to learn as it is more human like. 


I see, so what are the stuffs that may include in the WWW (world wide web)?

What you will touch from these 3 languages:

Protocol Layers: The internet includes different layers, which provide different data connections of different devices and services. 
-	Application Layer (7)
-	Transport Layer (4)
-	Network Layer (3)
-	Link Layer (2)

And the internet mainly uses Transport Layer to perform receive the data and IP addresses of the website from the Domain Name Servers

Any other info please just fucking revise your notes, this shit is for clearing concepts.
